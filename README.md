# Break-Point-Impact-on-Point-by-Point-Outcomes-in-ATP-Tennis-Matches
This is my MSc Dissertation “Exploring the Impact of Break Points and Contextual Variables on Point-by-Point Outcomes in ATP Tennis Matches”.

'Dissertation' is my full dissertation.

'Dissertation Script' is my completed R script.

'pbp_matches_atp_main_current' is the initial dataset I used. 

My dissertation, “Exploring the Impact of Break Points and Contextual Variables on Point-by-Point Outcomes in ATP Tennis Matches”, which scored a Distinction, investigated how pressure moments (like break points) influence player performance in professional tennis. 

Using data from over 178,000 match points and statistical modelling techniques (GLMMs and Random Forests), I found that break points significantly increase the odds of the server losing the point, which highlights how psychological pressure affects performance even at the elite level. 

This project strengthened my skills in R, data cleaning, statistical modelling and performance analysis.
